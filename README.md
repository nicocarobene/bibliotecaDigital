## Project Structure

Inside your Astro project, you'll find the following folders and files:


```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Book.astro
|   |   └── ListOfBook.astro
|   |   └── Title.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   ├── mock/
│   │   └── mock.json
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
│       └── [id].astro
│       └── 404.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
